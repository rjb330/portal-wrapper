# Portal Wrapper

## Introduction

Portal Wrapper is a desktop-agnostic fork of the old KGtk software that allows
some GTK apps without native portal support to use desktop portals.

To start an app with portals, use the following command:

    portal-wrapper <application>

## TODO

- Fix GTK3 file dialogs.
- Add support for filters.
- Add support for custom widgets.
